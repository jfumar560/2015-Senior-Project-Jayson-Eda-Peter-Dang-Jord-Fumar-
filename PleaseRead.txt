This is from our Electrical Engineering Senior Project at SJSU.
We made a Smart Shower which conserves water in many different ways.

First, we recirculate the water back to the heater 
if the temperature is cold.

Second, we have a display that tells the user how much water is consumed.

Third, we have voice control because why the fuck not.

Fourth, we have awesome cool LED light gauge that indicates the temperature level.

Code practice can be better. Will refactor when bored.

More soon.
